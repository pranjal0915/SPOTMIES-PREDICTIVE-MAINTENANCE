# Predictive Maintenance Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

This project demonstrates a predictive maintenance reporting solution built using SQL Server and Power BI.

## Project Overview
Machine sensor data was structured and processed in SQL Server, where analytical views were created to identify machine risk levels based on temperature and vibration indicators. Power BI was used to visualize operational trends, highlight high-risk machines, and present management-level summaries.

## Tools Used
- SQL Server (Data preparation & risk logic)
- Power BI (Visualization & reporting)

## Key Features
- Machine-level risk classification
- High-risk machine identification
- Management summary dashboards
- Interactive filtering and prioritization

## Folder Structure
- `SQL/` – Database creation and analytical views
- `PowerBI/` – Power BI dashboard file
- `Screenshots/` – Dashboard and SQL evidence

## Use Case
This dashboard supports proactive maintenance decisions by helping teams identify machines requiring immediate attention.
